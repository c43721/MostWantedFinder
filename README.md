# MostWantedFinder
A project aimed to teach us the fundementals of recursion and callbacks.

As a group project, we were tasked to using array methods, callbacks, and functions to re-create a person finder. Recursion was used to find descendants, and we use methods such as Array.filter() to filter results to a single person. I was not given a group, but instead tasked this project alone.
